# li-permit-tracker
This application allows users to track their L+I permit application by its ID.
It uses the [pattern portfolio](http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/patterns/)
to provide a consistent experience. It was forked from the [311 service request tracker](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/service-request-tracker).
